# BanknoteFitnessClassification
Detecting anomalies on banknotes in reality is a highly complex issue. In this paper, we will address the most typical and fundamental issues as a basis for further research. Therefore, our team will approach the problem as follows:
The banknote under study is a $10 bill. The input is an image of the banknote taken on a flat surface, with the bill oriented in the same direction. The bill is flat, without missing angles or incomplete signs. The bill may be slightly tilted up to 45 degrees and may have noise. The following issues are identified:
+ Cut out the banknote image and remove the background in the input image.
+ Rotate the banknote image to the same orientation and position as the template image.
+ Filter out all noise in the image, which may be due to poor image quality or dirt on the bill.
+ After filtering the banknote image, compare it to the template image, identify any differences (such as smudges) and highlight them on the screen.
